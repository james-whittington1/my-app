# My-App


This repository contains a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`, showcasing a modern web application setup with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion for animations. It's designed to serve as a starting point for building scalable web applications with a focus on performance, developer experience, and best practices.


## Features


- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendering and static web applications.

- **TypeScript**: Adds static type definitions to ensure code reliability and predictability.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.

- **Framer Motion**: A library to power animations in React applications.

- **API Routes**: Demonstrates how to handle API requests within the Next.js framework.


## Getting Started

Key Components

    Pages: The pages directory contains the application's page components, including the main index page (index.tsx) and API routes (e.g., api/hello.ts).
    Styles: Global styles are managed with Tailwind CSS in styles/globals.css, and component-specific styles are in styles/Home.module.css.
    Components: Reusable components like menu.tsx and toggles.tsx demonstrate interactive UI elements.
    Configuration Files: Configuration for Next.js (next.config.js), TypeScript (tsconfig.json), Tailwind CSS (tailwind.config.js), and PostCSS (postcss.config.js) are included to customize the build and development processes.

Deployment
